        <p class="sectag text-big">Logistical activities </p>
        <p class="sectag2 ">The transport at ease and effordable Logistical activities can be divided into three main areas, namely order processing, inventory management, and freight transportation. Traditionally, order processing was a time-consuming activity that can take up to 70% of the order-cycle time. However, with the advent of new technologies such as bar code scanning, computers, and network connection, orders from customers can quickly reach the seller in no time and the availability of stocks can be checked in real-time. The purpose of having an inventory is to reduce the overall logistical cost while improving service to customers. Having a stockpile of finished goods beforehand can reduce the frequency of transportation to and from the customers and cope with the randomness of customer demands. However, maintaining an inventory requires capital investment in finished goods and maintaining a warehouse. Storage and order picking occupies for most of the warehouse maintenance cost. </p>

        <p class="sectag2 ">The transport at ease and effordable Procurement logistics consists of activities such as market research, requirements planning, make-or-buy decisions, supplier management, ordering, and order controlling. The targets in procurement logistics might be contradictory: maximizing efficiency by concentrating on core competences, outsourcing while maintaining the autonomy of the company, or minimizing procurement costs while maximizing security within the supply process.

            Advance logistics consists of the activities required to set up or establish a plan for logistics activities to occur.
            
            Global logistics is technically the process of managing the "flow" of goods through what is called a supply chain, from its place of production to other parts of the world. This often requires an intermodal transport system, transport via ocean, air, rail, and truck. The effectiveness of global logistics is measured in the Logistics Performance Index.</p>
